Reproduced Papers
=================

MerLin enables researchers to reproduce and build upon published quantum machine learning research.
This section provides implementations of key papers in the quantum ML field, complete with working code, analysis, and extensions.

Overview
========

Each reproduction may include:

* **Original paper implementation** - Faithful recreation of the paper's methodology
* **Reproduction status** - Indicating whether the reproduction is partial or complete
* **Jupyter notebooks** - Interactive exploration of results and concepts
* **Full code** - Available on GitHub for easy access and modification
* **Performance analysis** - Comparison with paper results
* **Extension opportunities** - Ideas for building upon the work

.. note::
   All reproductions are implemented using MerLin's high-level API, making them accessible to ML practitioners without deep quantum expertise.
